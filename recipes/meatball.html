          <ul>
        
    
             <li>1 cup vital wheat gluten</li>
       
    
             <li>4 ½ cups vegetable broth, divided</li>
       
    
             <li>¼ cup liquid aminos (such as Bragg®)</li>
       
    
             <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
       
    
             <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
       
    
             <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic</li>
       
    
             <li>4 cups water</li>
       
    
             <li>¼ cup tamari</li>
       
    
            
    
          </ul>
    
          <h4>Step 1 </h4>
          <pre>
            Stir wheat gluten, 1/2 cup broth, liquid aminos, nutritional yeast, oil,
            and garlic together in a bowl until ingredients come together into a ball.
            Knead until dough has a rubbery texture. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces
             and shape into 1/2-inch-thick patties.
          </pre>
          <h4>Step 2 </h4>
          <pre>
            Combine remaining 4 cups vegetable broth, water, and tamari in a large pot;
            bring to a boil. Carefully lower patties into boiling broth; cover the pot
            and return to a boil. Set the lid slightly askew to vent steam and reduce 
            the heat to low. Continue simmering, turning occasionally, until patties 
            are firm, about 1 hour.


          </pre>
          <h4>Step 3 </h4>
          <pre>
            Remove from the heat and uncover the pot. Allow patties to cool in broth for
             15 minutes before serving.
